# Architecture 

There are multiple definitions for the term architecture, depending on the context, and the development branch you come from. For these reasons is complicated to reach a consensus and a single definition that is valid for all cases. So, according to frontend software development, and from a professional point of view, the definition could be the next:

Developers call architecture the set of development patterns that allow us to define guidelines to be followed in our software in terms of limits and restrictions. It is the guide that we must follow to order our code and make the different parts of the application communicate with each other.

There is a wide range of options when it comes to choosing one architecture or another. Each will have its own advantages and disadvantages. Even once we choose which one is the best suited to our case, it does not necessarily have to be implemented in the same way in different projects.

However, although the amount of options is almost infinite, the most keep their quality attributes in common, such as: scalability, single responsibility, low coupling, high cohesion, etc.

So, in general way, it's crucial to understand the concepts, and the reason why you have chosen one solution or the other.

One of the most used patterns to design software architecture is Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters.

The purpose of this pattern is to divide our application in different layers, allowing it to evolve in an isolated way and making each entity responsible for a single functionality.
